# Online Market Simulator
This is an online market simulator. We can simulate the server that manages the operations, or a client that can buy products.

You start the server simulator by opening the Server.jar file, and the client simulator by opening the Client.jar file.

On the server simulator, you can:
- View what users are registered on the system, as well as the products and their respective quantities
- Register new products, by switching to the products tab and clicking the "Add Product" button
- Update a product information (quantity and price), by selecting a product and clicking the "Update Product" button
- Restock your products, by clicking the "Ask provider" button, selecting a provider and placing an order
- Import and export the current users and products information (to a CSV file), by selecting the appropriate option on the "File" menu bar

On the client simulator, you can:
- TODO
